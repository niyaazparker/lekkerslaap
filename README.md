Task: create an accommodation search Results ‘Card’

LekkeSlaap is looking for a new accommodation search results ‘card’ specifically developed for iPhone XS.  
The objective is to create a great looking “card” which would entice our customers to click through and make the booking. 
You may use our website for reference (https://www.lekkeslaap.co.za/akkommodasie-in/kampsbaai) and there is an example 
layout design below, but feel free to use your creativity to create something that you feel is appropriate and shows off 
your skills.  Remember: this is a functional and informative piece of content on a travel or accommodation booking site 
but it should also try to appeal visually to a type of user you are designing for (family orientated, solo traveller). 
You are welcome to create more than one if for example you feel a different design might appeal to different types of users.

The card must be optimised for iPhone XS and have the following information pieces:
Establishment Image
Establishment Name
Establishment Extract ( shortened version of description max two lines)
“View More” button ( has to link to establishment )
Special banner with text “Premium”
Optional additions to card:
Guest Reviews
Price
… anything else you feel would help the user experience
Assessment Criteria
We will be looking at the quality of the code (css/scss , html ,semantics, readability) as well as your design. What design decisions you have made and why you have made them. Continue to page 2.
